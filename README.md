# pentesting-tools

This repository regroups all the tools I wrote as I followed Zaid Sabih's "Learn Python and Ethical Hacking from Scratch" course on Udemy.

Every program you see in here was originially written by Zaid Sabih and ZSecurity, and whatever credits should go to them.
Here is a link to his course which I highly recommend: https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-python-and-ethical-hacking-from-scratch/

Note: The programs are written for Python 2.7, most of them will not work with Python 3. Some of them take no arguments and have ip addresses or other parameters hardcoded into them because I couldn't be bothered to implement arguments for each and every command, maybe I will change that later.
